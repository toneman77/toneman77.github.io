# TL;DR
## per guild $5/m
This method allows everyone within the guild to use every command, whether registered or added. Zbot checks to see if someone within the guild has purchased this and runs commands if it's true.

## per user $1/m
This method allows every command to work as above but only for the current user. Requires a valid LINE ID.

## To those who donated when I said I was going to retire.

I announced that the bot would no longer be in service sincerely thinking that 50 people would wish me luck and I'd be on my merry way. Instead it was a total shitshow; people started some funding campaign and a lot of people donated. Despite rumors, I was NOT trying to cash grab. I didn't even know people did that until I checked my email. If this was you, thank you! I will gladly apply your donation to zbot time. Unfortunately, paypal only tells me your name and receipt ID. I don't know who you are in AT. If you donated, just **PM me relevent info** and what you want and I will apply it to your account.

##   Disclaimer

Zbot is a companion app which relies on Animation Throwdown. This may come as a surprise.. but.. AT doesn't have the strongest programming team lol. They break stuff constantly! I will do my best to keep the service going uninterrupted but it's not something I can guarantee. If you've used zbot prior to this, then expect the same service.

100% of everything on zbot works. If you find something that isn't working, then you are welcome to find me and ask questions. Please read the docs and understand how zbot is acquiring deck data before you ask. Some commands simply can't work without the actual account key.

Caveat: You can't spam AT servers. Each lookup request sends 50 requests to AT servers. Now, if 10 people happen to be looking up guilds at the same time, they are effectively spamming 500 requests to AT. Sometimes AT doesn't like it and sends back a "please try that again in a minute" response. Zbot doesn't say anything. All servers involved are functioning properly, but it may appear broken to you. Wait 10 seconds and try again. That's the best I can offer atm.
  
## Tech Support

If you need help with something, you can find me in **[this](https://line.me/R/ti/g/NPCNoCjlR9)** line group.

## How to sign up

There is a donate button built into the bot under 'donate'. Alternatively, paypal.me/zbot. If USD is not your currency, then just use google for currency translation. 5 USD in XXX where XXX is your currency. Whatever pops up should be accurate enough.

## Guild

In the special instructions, there is a spot for you to type something. Please include your guild's name and in-game ID or add code. The guild name should be enough. However, guild names are not unique and AT's searching function is atrocious so it's possible for me to apply it to the wrong guild inadvertently.

## Player

In the special instructions, there is a spot for you to type something. Please include your add code. If you have alts, you may include their add codes here. I'm putting a limit of 4 here or else people will suddenly have 500 alts lol
