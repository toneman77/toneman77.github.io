# how to register
Add zbot as a friend on LINE, PM zbot and say:
>register **user_id** **api_key**

(keep reading)
## what is "user_id"?
User ID is your in-game player ID. You can see it when you log into AT and click on your profile.

## What is api_key?

Every AT account is given a token (api key). This token acts like a signature when speaking to AT servers. If your user id and api key show up at AT servers, AT knows it's you and can answer requests.

## How do I get this stuff?
You can access the information directly through the bot provided you signed up through kongregate. It will not work if you login through facebook. Simply type: >konglogin your_username your_password 

to zbot. Zbot will spit out two values. The first is the user id; the second is the API key.
