 * What the heck is Zbot?

>Zbot is a bot built by **Zebleer** which allows people to access various amounts of information about Animation Throwdown by accessing the Kong APIs. While the information it receives back is in text form, Zbot is able to format this information for you so it looks good and makes sense. 
 
 * Is Zbot against Kong's terms of service?

>**No**. The information that Zbot accesses is open to the public if you know how to get it. This bot gives you knowledge and does not provide any advantage other than that.

 * How do I get access to Zbot?

>Zbot needs 1 person per guild to be admin. This person is responsible for adding Zbot as a friend and setting the guild up (this is relatively easy). Once your admin is set, every other member of the guild will need to add Zbot as a friend and type "add me" to it. This will give that person a unique code. Give this code to your admin and they'll set you up.

 * We're part of a coalition? 
 * How do we all get Zbot?

 >As stated above, each guild will need 1 person to be Zbot admin for that guild. Each admin will need to setup Zbot and add any members from **their guild** which want access to Zbot. Remember: 1 Zbot per guild and make sure you are registered to your guild's bot.

 * Can Zbot tell me things about other guilds?

>**Yes!** Zbot can give you guild information, as well as complete rosters of other guilds using the "lookup" and "roster" commands.

 * This is AWESOME! My friend is in another guild, can they use it too? Here's their code!

>**No**, it doesn't quite work like that. Even if the admin adds your friend to our Zbot registry, they will only be able to see information about our guild and our members. They won't even be able to see their own deck because they are not in our guild. If your friend really wants Zbot, they can ask their leadership to talk to Zebleer, or your friend can join our guild and get all the Zbot goodness :)

 * Do I have to use the guild chat with Zbot in order to use it?

>**No**, if you don't want to flood the chat with Zbot stuff, you can just ask Zbot directly with your pm chat. Zbot will give you all the same information in that chat, as it would in the group chat. 

 * This is really confusing, how am I going to learn all of these commands?

>Don't worry about it! Ask a guildmate who uses Zbot and I'm sure they'll help you. It's **really** not super hard and most people only ever use a few commands, anyway. Also, if you're overwhelmed with Zbot, then you definitely don't have to use it.

 * Why do some commands work for some people but not others?

>There are two very different systems in play here: Add codes and registry.

* **Add Codes:**

  If someone has added you with a code, then you can access your deck data through their account. Fmap yourname tells the person who added you to start a practice battle against you. From this practice battle, your deck information can be acquired. The account cannot fight you and magically see your inventory, research information, combo mastery, decks 1-5, etc... ONLY ACTIVE DECK INFO

 * **Registry:**

   If you've registered, then you have provided your personal account key. With this key, zbot can see everything. All decks, inventory, rumble/siege info, anything you can see in-game, zbot can see as well. There is no need to start a practice battle with the account because the deck info can be accessed directly.
