Something not working? Type 
>troubleshoot 

to zbot and follow the tips below.

>Line ID: Valid

* Access level 0-2
No valid LINE ID? Zbot is a LINE@ offical account and you must accept their terms before you can use it. After acceptance, LINE will issue you an ID and zbot can work for you. Friending the bot will implicitly accept these (I believe this only works for mobile)

>User ID: 7415638

* Access level 0-2 
This ID must belong to the person who added you. If it's incorrect, give your add code to a registered person within your guild.

* Access level 3
The user ID is shown in game when you click on your profile. This ID must belong to you If the ID is not yours, then you registered the wrong info. Please check the comment below for more details.

>User Name: Zebleer

* Access level 0-2
This name should be yours. If not, the person who added you has typed your name wrong. Have them re-add you.

* Access level 3
This name should be yours. If not, you've registered the wrong info. **Be careful** using 'konglogin' or appeternal.com/convert. Since the multiple account issue, some Kong accounts have multiple AT accounts. When you register, the first value MUST match your in-game player ID. If it doesn't, then it is **wrong.

  **! ATTENTION !**
If konglogin or eternal's app don't work, you may be forced into using the packet sniffer in your browser. Refer to the last entry under 'how to register' [here TODO](TODO) in this doc for more information.

>Guild Name: TheGuild of Calamitous Intent

* Access level 0-2
This guild should be yours. If not, give your code to a registered person within your guild.

* Access level 3
If this says null or is not your guild, type 'update guild'. If it says you're not in a guild and you know you are, then you've registered the wrong info. Read the tip above this for more info.

>You are speaking in a room that has been added

* Access level 0-2
If you've been added, then the bot will grab the account of the person whom added you. If you have not been added, it will grab the info of the room.

* Access level 3
Level 2 commands will work based on the room. Level 3 commands will work based on your own account. (level 3 commands are those under 'reg')
